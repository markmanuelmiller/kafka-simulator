# kafka-simulator

An easy-to-use Kafka simulator app for learning Kafka.

kafka-simulator is a great way to start learning about Kafka in

So you'd like to learn about Kafka but you aren't sure where to start? kafka-simulator is meant to provide an easy-to-use Kafka simulation environment to get you creating messages to partitions in no-time!

## Motivation

There are many moving parts with a Kafka cluster, which creates high barriers of entry. We wanted to develop a solution to fix this problem. With kafka-simulator, you can get a Kafka simulation environment up and running very quickly with little to no configuration required.

## Getting Started

**NOTE**: This project depends on Docker. For information on installing Docker, please visit [this page](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

Getting started is as easy as 1, 2, 3...

1. Download this repository

2. Run `npm run simulate`

3. Open another terminal and run `npm run bitcoin`

## Overview

There are a few pieces to kafka-simulator to be aware of.

First, we're using the `spotify/kafka` Docker image for Kafka and Zookeeper, referenced in the diagram below. The nice thing about this image is that it includes Kafka and Zookeeper together pre-configured. When you first run the `npm run simulate` command, this will download the image from dockerhub.com.

Now that we have Kafka and Zookeeper ready to go, we'll need a way to have a producer create a message to send to Kafka. This is where kafka-simulator comes in. Out-of-box, kafka-simulator is configured for 2 streams, a Bitcoin transactions stream, and a Yelp dataset stream that is generated by parsing a local dataset.

kafka-simulator uses streams and a producer to create messages that are sent to Kafka.

**NOTE**: kafka-simulator and KafkaMirror connect to Kafka through KafkaJS.

## Guides

The following guides will walk you through starting the Bitcoin transactions, or the Yelp dataset guide.

### Bitcoin Transactions Guide

The first input uses an open-source Bitcoin transactions WebSocket.

### Yelp Dataset Guide

This part requires a little extra work but is _very_ rewarding! With this method, you can parse a 5.2 million review Yelp dataset for reviews that include a word of your choosing. By default, the parser searches for reviews that include the word _pancake_, but you can easily change this to something a little more... intesting :)

#### Installing & Configuring the Yelp Dataset

1. To download the Yelp dataset, go to https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset and download the free datasets (a free kaggle account is required).
1. Once you've downloaded the dataset, place the `reviews.json` file in...
